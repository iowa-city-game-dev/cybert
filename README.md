# CyBert

A Discord bot for the Iowa City Game Dev Meetup.

## Adding CyBert to a Discord server

To add CyBert to a Discord server, use a browser to navigate to the URL `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<applicationId>&permissions=1342655552&scope=bot`, replacing `<applicationId>` with the ID of the application to connect CyBert to. You must be logged in to Discord through the browser in order to do this. If the bot is not set as public, you must be logged in as the Discord user that owns the application.
